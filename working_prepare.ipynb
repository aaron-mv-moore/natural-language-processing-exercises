To further celebrate, we’d like to spotlight each of our panelists leading up to the discussion to learn a bit about their respective experiences as women in the tech industry!  Meet Magdalena! Magdalena Rahn is a current Codeup student in a Data Science cohort in San Antonio, Texas. She has a professional background in cross-cultural communications, international business development, the wine industry and journalism. After serving in the US Navy, she decided to complement her professional skill set by attending the Data Science program at Codeup; she is set to graduate in March 2023. Magdalena is fluent in French, Bulgarian, Chinese-Mandarin, Spanish and Italian. We asked Magdalena how Codeup impacted her career, and she replied “Codeup has provided a solid foundation in analytical processes, programming and data science methods, and it’s been an encouragement to have such supportive instructors and wonderful classmates.” Don’t forget to tune in on March 29th to sit in on an insightful conversation with Magdalena.
